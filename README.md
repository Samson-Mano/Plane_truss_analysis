# Plane Truss Analyzer
A VB.Net application for creating and solving 2D trusses using the finite element method.

## Description

The project aims to provide a comprehensive tool for engineers and structural analysts to analyze 2D trusses with the help of finite element analysis. The application allows users to create truss structures, define material properties, apply loads and boundary conditions, and obtain accurate solutions for various structural parameters.

## Features

- Intuitive user interface for creating and editing 2D truss structures.
- Flexible material property definition, including elastic modulus, cross-sectional area, and more.
- Support for different types of loads, such as point loads and distributed loads.
- Boundary condition specification for realistic structural analysis.
- Efficient finite element solver to compute accurate results.
- Visualization of truss geometry, node displacements, member forces, and other relevant data.
- Exporting of analysis results for further processing or reporting.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Samson-Mano/Plane_truss_analysis.git`
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred VB.Net development environment.
3. Build the solution to compile the application.
4. Run the application and start analyzing 2D trusses.
